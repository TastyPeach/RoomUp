### Project Description:

Front end development done purely in react and Semantic UI, which will be restructued for scalability in the future. 

Back end development done in Django with MySQL.

We have created a roommate matching website called RoomUp, a platform that makes your life easier. It doesn't matter if you are looking for a temporary sublease, or if you just want to start a new lease for the upcoming year -- as long as you have some criteria in mind for your new potential roommates, our platform will help you find your new home with your best-match roomie.

The project comes from a real struggle experienced by our group members: trying to find a sublease. The real problem resides in finding a good roommate with whom we will be living with. When coming to a new place, it’s often easier to find an apartment since the apartment information is everywhere on the Internet, but it’s often harder to find roommates that are good matches for us. It would be a real disaster and a huge influence of our life quality if my roommates and I just randomly end up in the same place but quickly discovered that we don’t like each other. RoomUp is designated to solve this issue.
